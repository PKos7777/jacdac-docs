# Data Science Editor (Experimental)

The Data Science editor hosted at https://aka.ms/ds is an experimental editor to teach data science to middle school students.

## Getting started

The editor works in the browser and you don't need to install any additional software.
It comes with a few built-in datasets but it is also possible to import your own CSV data.

### "Data flows through blocks"

Each data blocks holds a dataset and acts as a transformation pipeline between other blocks. The pipeline looks as follows:

-   a data block receives an updated dataset from its predecessor
-   (optionally) the data block transforms the dataset. For example, it can sort the data according to a column.
-   (optionally) update charts or tables
-   the data block pushes the data to its successors

### ðŸ‘€ Data preview

The data blocks have a data preview button ðŸ‘€ that allows to quickly glance at the dataset attached to the block. If a block also transforms the dataset, a before/after view is provided.

### Loading and Saving projects

It is possible to load and save projects from files.

> Supported in Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge 90+ only!

The data editor will save projects as an entire folder, which allows to save the block code and additional data files. Copy those folders to share them with others.

### Importing CSV datasets

Aside from the builtin datasets, it is possible to import CSV files into the editor.
Imported datasets are stored as files in the project folder. This allows to share a project and all of its additional data.

If you modify the files outside the data editor, refresh the page to reload your changes.

#### Size limitations

The data science editor is meant for reasonably sized datasets (< 10 Mb). Various visualizations and charts will start dropping data in order to keep the editor responsive.

## GitHub

The editor is open source and currently hosted under Jacdac project in GitHub. It might move to its own repository in the future.
